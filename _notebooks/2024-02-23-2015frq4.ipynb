        "I focused on implementing the contains method within the `MultipleGroups` class. This class represents a collection of `NumberGroup` objects and implements the `NumberGroup` interface itself. The instance variable `groupList` holds the `NumberGroup` objects, initialized within the constructor. Within the contains method, I iterated through each `NumberGroup` object in the `groupList` using a for-each loop. For each group, I called its contains method to check if the provided integer is present within that group. If the contains method of any group returns true, indicating that the integer is found within at least one group, the contains method of `MultipleGroups` returns true immediately. Otherwise, if none of the groups contain the integer, the method returns false. To demonstrate the functionality of the implemented solution, I instantiated an instance of `MultipleGroups` named `multiple1` with a list of `NumberGroup` objects, specifically `Range` objects representing different numerical ranges. Testing the contains method with various integers, I verified its accuracy in determining whether the integer is contained in one or more of the number groups in `groupList`. For example, calling `multiple1.contains(150)` correctly returned true, `multiple1.contains(250)` returned false as expected, and `multiple1.contains(550)` returned true, validating the successful implementation of the contains method within `MultipleGroups`."

        "Through inheritance, the PersonJpaRepository extends JpaRepository, showcasing method sharing and coherence, reflecting concepts tested in FRQs. In my project, I've implemented a repository interface called PersonJpaRepository using Spring Data JPA to handle database operations for the Person entity. This interface extends JpaRepository and provides several methods for interacting with person data stored in a relational database. For instance, I've defined methods like findByEmail to retrieve a person by their email address and findAllByOrderByNameAsc to fetch all persons ordered by name in ascending order. Additionally, I've included custom query methods like findByLikeTermNative to execute native SQL queries for more complex operations. This is related to this FRQ because I created a Java interface named NumberGroup and a class Range that implements this interface. The Range class represents a range of numbers specified by a minimum and maximum value, and it includes a method contains to determine if a given number falls within that range. To fulfill the requirement of checking if a number is contained within any group in a list of NumberGroup objects, I implemented a standalone method contains that iterates through the list and returns true if the number is found within any NumberGroup, otherwise returning false."
