        "I started designing this class by first initializing a private instance variable called 'word' to store the hidden word. The class has a constructor that takes the hidden word as an argument and initializes the `word` variable with it. The most important method in this class is the `getHint` method. This method takes a player's guess as input and returns a hint based on the comparison between the guess and the hidden word. It iterates through each character in the guess and compares it with the corresponding character in the hidden word. If the characters match, it adds the character to the hint. If the character exists in the hidden word but in a different position, it adds a '+' to the hint. If the character does not exist in the hidden word, it adds a '*' to the hint. In order to test it in a creative manner, I made the HiddenWord guided user interface (GUI) similar to the popular word game Wordle. I did this because I was unable to make this similar to my project.\n",
