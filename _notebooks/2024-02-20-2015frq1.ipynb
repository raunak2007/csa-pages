        "The logic that I used to write the `arraySum` method was mostly based on iterating through all of elements of `arr`. While iterating, I added the value of each element to the variable `sum`, which was initialized to a value of 0, and used a for-each loop for convenience (since I am not modifying the elements of `arr` while iterating through it). Finally, I returned the value of `sum` at the end. My test code for this was inspired by my project as I used the `arraySum` method to find the (hypothetical) total number of employees logged into the website."

        "I first declared and initialized two 2D arrays. These arrays, `comp1` and `comp2`, represent employee counts categorized by location and occupation for two different companies. The program then proceeds to test the `isDiverse` method with these arrays. The `isDiverse` method checks whether the provided 2D array is diverse, meaning each row's sum is distinct from the sums of other rows. It does this by first calculating the sum of each row using the `rowSums` method. Then, it checks for any duplicate sums among these row sums. If it finds any duplicates, it returns false, indicating that the array is not diverse. Otherwise, it returns true. The `isDiverse` method is somewhat related to the KNN algorithm that our project group used for recommending jobs to potential applicants because it can detect which jobs are more or less competitive in different areas, which would feed into the layers of the KNN algorithm, making it more accurate at recommending jobs to potential applicants living in diverse geographical locations."
