After that, the presenters started talking about getting internships and job opportunities related to CS. I was deeply inspired by Tristan's experience, as he was able to get a great CS internship from the father of his friend Akhil Nandhakumar by showing the passion projects that he worked on during CSP and CSA. This motivated me a lot because I am also a close friend of Akhil and would definitely be interested in an internship opportunity at his father's company. In addition, it also motivated me because Tristan never planned on going to a 4-year college but still was able to get an internship at a good company nonetheless, saving him tens of thousands of dollars. In addition, Colin and Mabel talked about their experience with the Northrop Grumman HIP internship and how their initial one-year experience with Cyber Patriot helped them get that internship. In addition, they talked about how it is important to apply to internships early (usually in the fall of the school year you are applying in) and how it is also important to indicate whether you will be continuing the internships with your employer/team next summer or not. This impacted me because I am currently in an internship with the UCSD CSE Ujima Security and Privacy Lab and was able to successfully cold email and receive the internship by showing my experience with Python/machine learning fundamentals in CSP. However, I will utilize the advice given by the presenters in the Student Panel today and show my experience in CSP/CSA, my experience in past/current internships, and my personal projects, and will apply early to all the internships I want to target this year to maximize my chances of getting into a top 10 CS undergrad department the year after that.  

After that, the presenters started talking about their personal projects and their personal websites. In addition to Tristan's experience with personal projects he created during his time in CSP/CSA, he talked about his personal website, which he said isn't great right now (even though I personally thought it was awesome) and which he is going to update to make it even better. I asked him a question about what to put on a personal website besides resume-related details, and he responded by saying that you can put aesthetics/CSS-related tangibles, as well as personal projects that you have worked on and can show your current experience with CS. In addition, Colin and Mabel talked about their personal projects relating to an online storefront for a thrift shop at Escondido. I found that inspiring because it somewhat motivated me to make a website for Bengali businesses in San Diego who don't have much outreach besides word-of-mouth communication, which could deeply impact my community, friends, and family. In addition, Anthony mentioned about one of his friends being fascinated by Valorant and wanting to create a better version of Valorant using his CS skills. This gave me inspiration to do the same with Discord, given that I use Discord a lot and it would majorly benefit my friends if they had access to a more convenient form of Discord.

In conclusion, I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to attend this Student Panel and I thank the presenters for coming to this event in the midst of their (most likely) relatively-busy schedules. In addition, I am thankful for the Girls in CS club for hosting this special event. I hope the takeaways I learned from this event will prove to be useful and successful in the near future.
