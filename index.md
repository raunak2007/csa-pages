Go to my [Github account](https://github.com/raunak2007) !!

I currently live in San Diego and was born in Bangalore, India. I started coding since the age of 6 and my first experience with code was the [code.org](code.org) Hour of Code in 2nd grade and since then, I have had many pleasurable experiences with programming in the past decade, which have resulted in 1052 Github commits. My hobbies are playing basketball, listening to music, doing math problems, and most important of them all, programming in various languages.
