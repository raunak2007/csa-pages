# Journey, Learnings, and Discoveries

Certainly! Here's an integrated version:

In the four months of my AP Computer Science A (AP CSA) journey, I've encountered both challenges and remarkable achievements. One standout achievement involved delving into hashmaps in Java and exploring the time complexities of common sorting algorithms during a mini project. Despite my primary task being the implementation of a betting system for our race car game, examining the existing code that dictated the cars' paths and the time each car (representing a sorting algorithm) took to finish was fascinating. Additionally, creating a student lesson for the trimester exposed me to new jQuery concepts, making the lesson creation process more engaging.

As a team, we successfully developed a racing game that combined entertainment with education. Users could customize the number of elements for the sorting algorithms, place bets, and discover interesting facts about the algorithms, including Big O notation time complexities and sorting methodologies. Effective communication within our team, facilitated by a group chat, played a crucial role in our progress, helping us avoid issues like merge conflicts. However, we did face challenges, notably in deploying the backend component to AWS. An unexpected issue involving root user access disrupted many projects, leading us to showcase our backend database locally, adding a layer of complexity to demonstrating the sorting race.

Regarding the College Board quiz preparation, I took a practice MCQ test from Barron's AP CSA 2024 book, emulating AP exam conditions, and scored 37/40. Notably, the three incorrect answers were related to recursion. To fortify my recursion problem-solving skills, I consulted a study guide to deepen my understanding.

Reflecting on the multiple-choice test, I attribute my success to a combination of prior trimester lessons and the continuous learning of Units 1-10 over four to five weeks. These lessons, designed to reinforce fundamental concepts, played a crucial role in my high score. I believe their impact will persist throughout the year, aiding me in future assessments.

In summary, my AP CSA experience has been a balance of enjoyment, learning, and occasional challenges. Despite the imperfections, I am confident that these experiences will be beneficial, especially as I approach the stage in my high school career where I plan to apply for internships and programs utilizing the skills and concepts acquired in this class.

# Corrections

The rest of the blog will now be primarily focused on the multiple choice test that we were assigned to take this week.

As shown in the image above, I earned a score of 36/39 on this test, which is a very good score in my book. My score indicates that I have a very solid understanding of everything that we have studied in AP CSA so far (which is basically everything since we had all of those student lessons in the first trimester). While it is great that I was able to get this score on the test, it is important that I take the time to thoroughly review the concepts of the questions I got wrong, as that will ensure that I won't make the same mistakes in the future, especially while I take the actual AP exam MCQ section in May. 




## Question 9 (incorrect)

The first question to look over is question 9, which is shown below:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/question9.png)

The correct answer to this question was E, which was ```2 + (int) (Math.random() * 6) + (int) (Math.random() * 6)```. However, I ended up choosing C, which ended up being wrong due to the fact that replacing the missing code with that line would end up generating an integer between 0 and 10, inclusive, which we don't want. I think I wrongly assumed that if I simply added up the number generated from each simulated roll that it would yield the sum of the two dice rolls. This is not the case, as in order to create the correct sum, we need to make it so that the roll is from 1 to 6 and so that the range of possible sums is from 2 to 12. Now that I was able to review this question, I am a lot more clear on what went wrong and what I can do to improve myself the next time I encounter a question like this. 



## Question 16 (incorrect)

The next question to look over is question 16, which is shown below:


![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/question16.png)

The correct answer was E, which was that the code segment returned the column index of an element with the largest value in the two-dimensional array. I got this question wrong mainly due to my misunderstanding of what I saw in the code segment. I think that since I saw rows and indexes of rows being used throughout the code segment, I concluded that the correct answer had to have obviously been option C, which was that it returned the row index of an element with the largest value in the two dimensional array. After reviewing the explanation for all of the answer choices, including the correct one, I have a much better understanding of this question and feel confident that if I ever encounter a question like this in the future that I will be able to answer it correctly. 


## Question 22 (incorrect)

The next question to look over is question 22, which is shown below:

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/question22.png)

The correct answer was option A, which is the following code segment:

```java
for (int[] row : numbers)
{
    for(int n : row)
    {
        System.out.print(n);
    }
} 
```

This question was asking for the code segment that correctly produces the output of 123456. I think that I ended up choosing option E because of how I was quick to assume that because there was a 2D int array involved that it would involve the iteration of both rows and columns. After reviewing the explanation for the incorrect answer I chose as well as correct option A, I feel like I understand why I got this question wrong much better now. My answer E was incorrect because of how that code segment had a nested for loop iterate over the 2D array numbers in column major order, which would cause 142536 to be printed out instead. Option A is correct because the nested for loop iterates through every row of the 2D array numbers as well the elements in those rows. Following this pattern will output 123456, which is what we want. I think that for a question like this, it is important that I carefully examine the code segments given to me, as for this question, I kind of rushed through it without really thinking about what each choice meant. Because this question involves iteration, I think it would also be very helpful for me to have a piece of paper by my side so I can keep track of everything that is happening. If I try to do everything in my head, I could make a mistake somewhere without even realizing it and end up choosing the wrong answer.
