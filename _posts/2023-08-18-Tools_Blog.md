# Why I Love My Tools

I love my laptop because it allows for me to work on my AP Computer Science A projects without any worries. I love Github because it allows me to display my code to the whole wide world and save my work to the Cloud. I love Visual Studio Code because it allows me to display my blog when other methods of doing so don't work. I love Github Pages because it can display my blog for everyone to see most of the time. I love Jupyter Notebooks because they allow me to run machine learning models on large datasets in a very convenient manner. In addition, I can also run segments of Java, Javascript, and Python and demonstrate the usefulness of these languages in Jupyter Notebooks. I love Slack because it allows me to work, collaborate, and transfer ideas with my teammates in a very efficient manner (at least compared to Discord). I love Docker because it allows me to test and deploy any of my applications. In addition, I love Docker because it allows me to test deployment scripts on their local machines. I love Conda because it allows me to avoid dependencies and run data science projects in a very fast manner. I love Homebrew because it allows me to install tools in a very efficient and centralized manner. Lastly, I love AWS because it has deployed many of my previous projects in AP Computer Science Principles.
