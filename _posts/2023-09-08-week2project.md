# Initial Plan
## Frontend Goals:
1. Landing Page: Display a visually appealing landing page showcasing featured sports trading cards and a call to action to login or sign up.
2. User Registration: Create a user registration page where users can sign up for an account. Collect user information including username, email, password, and favorite sports.
3. User Profile: Allow users to create and customize their profiles. Users can upload a profile picture and enter additional details like their age, location, and favorite sports teams/players.
4. Trading Cards Catalog. Display a catalog of sports trading cards with images and details. Implement search and filter options to help users find specific cards based on players, teams, years, etc.
5. Card Details Page: When users click on a card, show a detailed view with information about the card's rarity, stats, and a description. Include options to add the card to the user's collection or initiate a trade.
6. User Collection: Create a section where users can view and manage their personal collection of sports trading cards. Implement sorting and filtering options to organize their collection.
7. Trading and Messaging: Allow users to send trade requests to other users for specific cards. Implement a messaging system for users to negotiate trades and discuss details.

## Backend Goals:
1. Database Setup: Create a database to store user profiles, trading card information, and trade requests. Design tables for users, cards, collections, and trades.
2. User Authentication: Implement user authentication using a secure method like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user login and registration.
3. API Endpoints: Develop API endpoints to handle user registration, login, and profile management. Create endpoints for browsing cards, viewing card details, managing collections, and initiating trades.
4. Matching Algorithm: Design a matching algorithm that suggests potential trades based on users' favorite sports, desired cards, and trading history.
5. Messaging System: Implement a messaging system that allows users to communicate securely within the platform.

## Additional Goals:
1. Advanced Filters: Enhance the card search functionality by allowing users to filter cards based on attributes like card type, rarity, and player stats.
2. Card Auctions: Add a feature for users to auction their cards to other users.
3. Notifications: Implement real-time notifications for trade requests, new messages, and card auctions.
4. Mobile App: Consider developing a mobile app version for a more seamless user experience on smartphones and tablets.
