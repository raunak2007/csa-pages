# Two Trimester focus planning
[Test Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17oJPhZWBdmWVEiNuKoodF60HHuUdLDJ0Sk7lBb8-JPM/edit?usp=sharing)
While presenting our project, we collected test data on feedback that our in order to see which areas of our project we need to grow in.
I plan to use the test data in order to find specific areas of our project to work with in Trimester 3.
The first thing that I plan to do is add more credits to our API (or upgrade to a better plan) so that more users can use it as indicated by Rachit.
In addition, we will add a dropdown menu that has programming languages as requested by Haseeb.
Another minor modification that we will do is to add multiple candidates that have the best proficiency in a skills in a certain location as requested by Paaras.
This makes sense because most employers in reality would want to look at multiple candidates to ensure that they have a variety of potential employees rather than having to choose whether they want to reject or hire one singular candidate.

# Me and the Team
Grows: We will make sure that we have kept the project maintained because some stuff can be maintained a lot more properly. We should also add a dropdown menu for languages when searching for workers
Glows: So many people showed up due to many interesting features, like a video meeting feature attracted a lot of people.

# Blog on Event
Something you saw in CompSci that impressed:

I thought that this was cool because this was a more Del Norte-centric version of Canvas that was modified to this school

Something you saw outside of CompSci that you liked:

I thought that this was somewhat interesting because most of my friends have done Photography and none of them have ever dared to do a project where they were lying on railroad tracks in order to take a picture.

I also thought that this was interesting to see because of the format and styling of the desk, chairs, cups, and donut was nice.
